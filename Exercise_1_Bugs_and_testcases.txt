BUGS:

header/Description:
TYPO: Header reads "Factoriall" and should read "Factorial"

STEPS:
1.Open https://qainterview.pythonanywhere.com/. Look at the page tab.
Expected: tab should read Factorial.



Header: UI:Arrow on calculator is unclickable
Description: Arrow to the left of the input field looks like a clickable item that should lead to calculations
Steps:
Enter digits and click on Arrow

Expected: arrow should be moved to the right of the input


Header: Links of terms and Privacy settings should be switched.
Description: Links of terms and Privacy settings are switched, privacy link leads to terms page and vice versa
Steps:
Click on link of terms and agreement
Click back and click on link of privacy
Expected: Links should lead to corresponding pages.


Header: No error notification on 500 server response
Description: When server returns 500 user has no notification of calculation failure:
Steps: 
Open Calculator page and calculate factorial for:
1234, -1, 1.5
Expected result:
User is notified that calculation failed

Header: Invalid result of calculation
Description: For numbers bigger than 172 calculation result is: "Infinity"
Steps:
Open calculator page
Calculate factorial for 172, 173 etc.
Expected result:
